# Cryptodate Art Collections #
As a platform, cryptodate supports the notion of collections:  NFTs grouped by a theme, an artist or another quality. Different collections own different token spaces of the entire possible NFT token ids. For example a collection might be a given day on every year, an entire year or an entire decade.
