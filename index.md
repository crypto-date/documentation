# Introduction

The [cryptodate system](https://www.cryptodate.io) combines existing blockchain primitives (ERC721, ERC20, automated market makers & staking rewards) to create a self-sufficient system that provides value for artists, investors and collectors. 

The system is a set of intertwined smart contracts:

1. An ERC721-compliant smart contract for minting NFTs 
2. An ERC20-complaint smart contract for providing rewards and enabling governance (CDT)
3. A liquidity pool 
4. A staking rewards contract for LP Tokens
5. A staking rewards contract for CDT

It brings the following innovations to the space:

1. **Fixed Rate, Yield Bearing NFTs.**   Each cryptodate generates yield for its owner as a fixed return of CDT. 
2. **Automated Liquidity Provisioning Through NFT Sales.** 50% of each NFT sale goes directly into a liquidity pool, increasing the value of CDT.
3. **Community Driven Commissioning Of Art**. CDT is a utility and governance token used to fund artists through community driven commissions.
4. **Token Ids With Semantic Meaning**. The token id of the cryptodate is the date itself, requiring no external metadata for its intrinsic value.
5. **Immutable and Mutable Metadata**. Cryptodates have both immutable and mutable metadata, creating a novel NFT minting system.
