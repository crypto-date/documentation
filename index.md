# Introduction

The [cryptodate system](https://www.cryptodate.io) combines existing blockchain primitives (ERC721, ERC20, automated market makers & staking rewards) to create a self-sufficient system that provides value for artists, investors and collectors. 

Cryptodates are novel nfts. Each date from 1950 to 2049 is an on chain NFT, represented by unique artwork. Owning dates grants access to exclusive clubs. Additionally, owning dates earns fixed yield in the form of CDT tokens. CDT is governance token used to commission art for cryptodates and vote on other proposals of the system. Cryptodates have on chain data -- the token id is the date itself -- as well as off chain data in the form of art. 

The system is a set of intertwined smart contracts:

1. An ERC721-compliant smart contract for minting NFTs 
2. An ERC20-complaint smart contract for providing rewards and enabling governance (CDT)
3. A liquidity pool 
4. A staking rewards contract for LP Tokens
5. A staking rewards contract for CDT

It brings the following innovations to the space:

1. **Fixed Rate, Yield Bearing NFTs.**   Each cryptodate generates yield for its owner as a fixed return of CDT. 
1. **Liquidity Provisioning Through NFT Sales.** 50% of each NFT sale goes directly into a liquidity pool, increasing the value of CDT.
1. **Token Ids With Semantic Meaning**. The token id of the cryptodate is the date itself, requiring no external metadata for its intrinsic value. The date is represented on chain.
