# Introduction

[Cryptodates](https://www.cryptodate.io) combine existing blockchain primitives (ERC721, ERC20, automated market makers & staking rewards) to create a self-sufficient system that provides value for artists, investors and collectors. 

Cryptodates are novel nfts. Each date from 1950 to 2049 is an on chain NFT, represented by unique artwork. Owning dates grants access to exclusive clubs. Additionally, owning dates earns fixed yield in the form of CDT tokens. CDT is governance token used to commission art for cryptodates and vote on other proposals of the system. Cryptodates have on chain data -- the token id is the date itself -- as well as off chain data in the form of art. 

The cryptodate smart contracts have been deployed to multiple blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalache, Fantom and Moon River. See [Smart Contracts](smart-contracts.md) for deployment addresses and verification links.

Cryptodate brings the following innovations to the space:

1. **Fixed Rate, Yield Bearing NFTs.**   Each cryptodate generates yield for its owner as a fixed return of CDT. 
1. **Liquidity Provisioning Through NFT Sales.** 50% of each NFT sale goes directly into a liquidity pool, increasing the value of CDT.
1. **Token Ids With Semantic Meaning**. The token id of the cryptodate is the date itself, requiring no external metadata for its intrinsic value. The date is represented on chain.
